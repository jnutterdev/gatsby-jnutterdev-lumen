Hi, if you didn't know already, my name is John Nutter. I'm a back-end web developer and Linux sysadmin. I have a passion for working with Ruby on Rails and Flask.<!--more--> I'm seeking any opportunity I can to write code using it. In this first post, I'm going to go over some details on how I created this site and the tools that I used. It's not at all an exhaustive post, but just something I put together to get the ball rolling. 


For starters, the website itself is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I'm using version 4.0.0 at the time of this writing, along with Ruby version 2.6.3, and a few other gems. The template I'm using is a free Jekyll version of the "Forty" theme by [HTML5 UP](https://html5up.net/) that I came across. I've made some edits to it, mainly removing sections that I don't think I'll use. So hopefully, everything makes sense.   

I found [favicon.co](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) to quickly generate a favicon for the site using some of the main colors. For all of the index page images and posts, I'm using images found on the free site [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/). The artists are a few scattered throughout, so I'm working on getting the details to add to the posts and give them credit. Though, the nice thing about this site is it's totally royalty-free. 

The site's colors are where I struggle the most. I usually upload an image to [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/) and then pick out a color and tinker with it until I get something that I like. I'll go through 100 different iterations of those colors and combinations before I can finally get something that I like. The hardest part is finding a color combination that looks good, represents me, and that I won't get tired of later on. Darker backgrounds with brighter foreground tend to be the best combination for me.
