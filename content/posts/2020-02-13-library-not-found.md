It's been a while since I've worked on any projects lately, so I decided that it will get me back into the swing of things if I start writing about a project. I didn't have the repo cloned or this site, so the first thing I did was pull it down from GitHub.<!--more-->


Next, I tried to fire up [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). I get an error, "library not found for class Digest::SHA2 -- digest/sha2 (LoadError)". Crap. What is that all about? Nothing has changed since my last post; what gives? 

I searched around for a little while, but stack overflow was letting me down. Some folks were saying to try this thing or edit that moduleâ€”many things that didn't seem relevant to my situation. To see if it may have been specific to my ruby versions, I tried using an older version with [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv). No luck. I get a host of other errors. 

Finally, I did the only sensible thing I can think of. rbenv uninstall ruby 2.5.1. Afterward, I re-installed Jekyll and bundler. I updated my gems. Ran bundle install. It works! I was so relieved. 

Now that I have a working Jekyll setup expect more posts to come soon. I will be looking into a few different projects, either with ruby on rails or flask. Stay tuned.
